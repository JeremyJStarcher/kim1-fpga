# kim1-fpga

KIM-1 in an FPGA heavily based off the excellent work by
Stephen A. Edwards.

## Boards

The keyboard and LED board is designed to be generic and univeral, allowing me to easily move it between 
different systems and emulations that I am working with.  The I/O board should be totally agnostic to the
device it is plugged into.

Each FPGA development board will have an adaptor board to bring out the signals needed.
